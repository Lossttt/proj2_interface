# Graphical User Interface for 42 B.V.

The login and signup forms are implemented using JavaFX, a framework for creating desktop applications with Java. The forms provide a user-friendly interface for users to authenticate and create new accounts.


## Features

__Login Form__: Users can enter their email address or user ID along with their password to log in to the system. It verifies the user credentials against a predefined user database and grants access based on the provided information.

**Signup Form**: Users can register for a new account by providing their email address, password, and other required information. The form includes basic validation to ensure that the entered data meets the specified criteria.
